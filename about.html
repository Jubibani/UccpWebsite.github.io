    <legend>How we started</legend>
     <p>
      The United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) is an indigenous evangelical church formed by the union of Protestant Mission churches and institutions in 1948. This union includes the Presbyterian, Philippine Methodist, Brethren, Disciples and Congregational Churches.

      We are a vibrant and diverse community of 500,000 members with 2,492 pastors in 2,850 local churches and worship congregations all over the Philippines. We guide our members in their journey of Christian faith and witness. We equip them to lead a healthy congregational life and to engage in active ministry with their local community.
      
      We work for human rights, justice, peace, and the integrity of creation. We are a church that gladly welcomes change. And we are so glad to welcome you here in our website.
     </p>
